 You need to display the input image on a website page using HTML canvas.

 The input file is a text file that represent an image by RGBA Colors, which means that every 4 values (0-255 separated by a comma) represent the color of one pixel. 
 The size of the image appears in the file name right after the Dash sign. (for example, if the file name is chuck-550x524.txt, the image width is 550px and the image height is 524px).
